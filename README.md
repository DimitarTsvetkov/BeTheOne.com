# BeTheOne.com
BeTheOne is a project for a motivation website
The idea of creating a project like this is to help the ones who know what they want to achieve, but lack a little self-confidence and need small push to do the next step (in career, relationships, sport, health etc).
This is a project for a website for motivational advises in order to become more successful in everything that we are doing.
The motivational advises are grouped in different categories workout, study, career and love.
There is build in random motivational quote generator, inspiring success stories, a section with some of the most inspiring quotes of the idols of our time and YouTube API to search for motivational video content. 
This is not the final product, there is a lot of work to do and to add here in order to make a great user experience and full functionality.
Until now i have used: HTML5, CSS,JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax.
